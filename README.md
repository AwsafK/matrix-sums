#matrix sums

THIS IS A CLASS PROJECT

This program reads a lightly formatted .txt file full of matrices. The program uses the data from the .txt file to calculate the sum of each column in the matrix. The program then determines whether or not the 
matrix is vertically additive. 

The program uses cmd as the interface.
